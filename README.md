Each agent has a specific role and works sequentially to build the final travel plan.Location Expert: This agent gathers essential logistical information about the destination, such as weather, transportation options, cost of living, and visa requirements.City Local Guide Expert: This agent acts as a local guide, finding the best attractions, restaurants, and events based on your stated interests.Travel Planning Expert: This agent takes all the information gathered by the other two agents and compiles it into a structured, day-by-day itinerary, complete with a city introduction and helpful tips.The application is powered by a local Large Language Model (LLM) via Ollama (llama3.2) and uses DuckDuckGo for real-time web searches to ensure the information is up-to-date.🛠️ Technologies UsedBackend: PythonAI Framework: CrewAILLM Integration: LangChain, OllamaWeb Interface: StreamlitWeb Search: DuckDuckGo Search🚀 Setup and InstallationFollow these steps to get the Trip Advisor application running on your local machine.PrerequisitesPython 3.8 or higherOllama installed and running.The llama3.2 model pulled in Ollama.
